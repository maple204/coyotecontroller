Download the Coyote Controller.zip file to you mac.

Unzip it and it will be "Coyote Controller.app" and drop that in your apps directory

Open Terminal and paste this:

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Coyote\` [`Controller.app`](http://Controller.app) 

(It's an Apple security thing. Also, you'll need Google Chrome installed to open the browser window.)

Run the app!

No warrenty and use at your own risk. All the typical estim safety rules for the coyote apply.

Feel free to suggest improvements.
